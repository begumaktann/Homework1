Question 1
You will be given a list, assume the list will not be empty, consists of floats. You are required to compute some statistical values according to given definitions and formulas.

Length: Number of elements in the list: 
Minimum: Minimum element of the list and its index number.
Max: Maximum element of the list and its index number.
Sum: Summation of the list: 
Mean: Mean of the list: .
Variance: Mean of the list: .
Note:

Do not forget to count from 0 for index number.
In the case of multiple maximum/maximum number, smallest index will be accepted.
Do not use any built-in function like len, mean, etc. otherwise, you will not get any points! The aim is to calculate necessary values by iterating over the list.
Input Format

Space seperated float values 3.14 2 53 12.2

Output Format

Space Seperated Statistical Values with Precision 5

{Length} {Minimum with precision 5} {Minimum Index} {Maximum with precision 5} {Maximum Index} {Sum with precision 5} {Mean with precision 5} {Variance with precision 5}
